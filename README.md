# LAB-DMX
LAB-DMX is a DMX library for Java, intended to provide additional DMX support and features beyond the DMX specification. This includes device definition, and DMX driven effects on those devices at a universe or device level.

## Requirements
LAB-DMX is built on the [artnet4j](https://code.google.com/p/artnet4j/) project, as well as the [Apache Commons Lang](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/). LAB-DMX can be used in any Java project that includes these libraries.

## Documentation
LAB-DMX has full JavaDoc commenting support.
